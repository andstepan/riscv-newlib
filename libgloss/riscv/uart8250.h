 *
 * This is a bare-metal driver for the 8250 UART module. This driver 
 * is a modified version of the original 8250 UART driver found in the
 * RISCV OpenSBI repo.
 * 
 * The actual silicon and the virtual prototype implement the NS16650 
 * hardware, which is backwards compativle to the 8250. Their difference is 
 * that the NS16650 is FIFO-based and thus better for multiprogramming 
 * environments, but in this case where we do bare-metal programming, 
 * the FIFO does not provide any significant advantage.
 *
 * To use this driver, the user should first call the UART 
 * initialization function in order to bring the hardware to a 
 * known state.
